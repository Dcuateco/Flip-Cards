                    <h1>The Exorcist</h1>
                    <p>1973</p>
                    <p>One of the most recognized movies from the '70s is the infamous exorcist. When this movie was released in 1973 viewers had never seen anything as grotesque as this film was. This movie was a turning point for horror films and paved the way for the many demon possession films that exist today.

                        <p>The Shining is a film that is based off the novel that Stephen King wrote. King was known for his books at the time and the recently released Carrie film so many were excited for this one. However, no one knew how popular this film would become. In big part due to Jack Nicholson's acting it was praising by critics and was watched over and over again by many fans.</p>

                        <p>Alfred Hitchcock's Psyhco was a masterpiece when it was released in 1960. Although Hitchcock had made a name for himself with his television shows, Paramount did not want a movie like Psycho being made. Alfred decided to make the move while on a low budget and what resulted from it was a cultural landmark. The film was full of twist and turns but the big thing that really shocked viewers was that the leading girl was kill off in the first hour of the movie.</p>

                        <p>Halloween was the film that really set of the slasher franchise and gave us one of the most spinechilling film soundtracks out there. This film was created on a very low budget but made around 70 million dollars. It is one of the most iconic movies ever created and produced a series of sequals that are still being made to this very day. </p>

                        <p>Due to the success of Halloween films like Friday the 13th were made. This film series produced one of the most recognized faces when it comes to slasher horror. The infamous ski mask is something that kids use to have nightmares about and for good reason. The success of Friday the 13th propelled 12 films with one of them being the most anticipated crossover between horror characters. Although the franchise has been going through legal trouble, the ski mask is bound to cross the big screen again at some point.</p>

                        <p>From the wicked mind of Wes Craven comes another recognized face in Freddy Kreuger. When this film was released many were scared to sleep themselves due to the idea of Freddy getting them in their sleep. Due to the success of the film we saw 8 more films following the first one and even saw a Freddy vs Jason fight. Although it's most recent adaptaition was a failure we are bound to see the pepperoni faced, knived hand killer again as some point.</p>
